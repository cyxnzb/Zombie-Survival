# Zombie Survival
 
This is a custom-made CSGO gamemode that i've created with a friend, we really loved CS 1.6 zombie plague so we tried to make it on CSGO too.

This plugin contains lots of features, i don't remember them all, but some of them are:

- MySQL account system with character creation (STEAM ID associated)
- All of common zombie plague content (humans vs zombies and custom modes)
- Levels & resets system
- Weapons by levels & resets
- Custom weapons (models, damage, name, effects, etc)
- Zombie & Human classes
- Some custom weapons like bazooka and chainsaw (thanks qubka!)
- Custom rounds
- Black hole & aura shield (took some code from void grenade from alliedmods)
- Fire/freeze/light grenades
- Leap jump
- Perks upgradeable with zombie/human points

And so on..

By now, you should have already remembered how it was back in CS 1.6, so, now it's free to use, since i can't make it better because we have no time left.

I would really like to thank:
- CODES: my friend that motivated & helped me to make this (we know it could be better, but we had to learn and practise)
- PIU GAMES COMMUNITY: My community, they helped me a lot creating maps, models and so on, so we could reach a nice server.
- Alliedmods community: Took a lot of code from them, qubka e.g. (he created and posted the zombie plague for CSGO) did a lot that we took from his code and adapted to ours.
- Everyone that sees some part of code that is really similar to what he/she has posted on AlliedModders.

THERE IS A LOT OF CODE THAT I COULDN'T IMPLEMENT CORRECTLY, SO, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CHECK BY YOURSELF IF YOU WANT TO DELETE IT.

From now on, i will start uploading files so you can use them and make your own server using this as a base.
